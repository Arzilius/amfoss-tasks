# Amfoss-tasks
# Introduction
My name is Adarsh Renjith and I'm studying CSE(AI) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeedam. I used to be biomaths in high school so I don't have much of a computer background, I am however, eager to learn and explore what all computer science has to offer. I do use my computer a lot for gaming, watching youtube and chatting with my friends
# Why should we choose you?
I am excited about this opportunity and I am eager to learn and willing to put effort into mastering computer science, may it be coding, troubleshooting or trying to solve problems, I am up to doing such tasks to reach goals in the realm of computations. I believe I will be able to make a positive change in the club. I will try my best to keep on improving and thinking of new ways to solve problems
# How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I look forward to learning and acquiring skills and using those skills effectively, actively learning new things and growing along with the club. I'm looking forward to contribute to the club activities and embracing new challenges that force me to push my limits and further develop my abilities. I also wish to be at a point where I can mentor my juniors and hopefully understand new perspectives and feedbacks
# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
I am interested in solving problems in creative ways and understanding how something works. A childhood habit of mine was taking apart some toys to look inside and see the machinery, I also had a minecraft server with my friends which I hosted, I used to play with the minecraft commands a lot and learnt a lot of different commands which are relatively unheard of in the minecraft community. I believe I am creative and like solving problems. I wish to work on them by learning new/different methods of doing a particular problem. I wish to see different perspectives and ideas and take inspiration from them in the future
