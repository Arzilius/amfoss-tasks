| **Introduction**                  | My name is Adarsh Renjith and I'm studying CSE(AI) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeedam. I used to be biomaths in high school so I don't have much of a computer background. I am eager to learn and explore what all computer science has to offer. I do use my computer a lot for gaming, watching YouTube, and chatting with my friends. |
| **Why should we choose you?**     | I am excited about this opportunity and am eager to learn and willing to put effort into mastering computer science, whether it's coding, troubleshooting, or problem-solving. I believe I will be able to make a positive change in the club. I will try my best to keep improving and thinking of new ways to solve problems. |
| **How do you intend to contribute back to the club?** | I look forward to learning and acquiring skills and using those skills effectively. I am eager to actively learn new things and grow along with the club. I aim to contribute to club activities and embrace new challenges to push my limits and further develop my abilities. Additionally, I hope to mentor juniors and gain new perspectives and feedback. |
| **What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?** | I am interested in solving problems creatively and understanding how things work. A childhood habit was taking apart toys to see their machinery. I also hosted a Minecraft server and experimented with commands. I believe I am creative and enjoy problem-solving. I plan to work on this by learning new methods and gaining different perspectives to inspire future solutions. |
