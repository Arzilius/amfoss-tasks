How I did the third task

The first subtask was by far the easiest, there are plenty of youtube tutorials explaining how to print hello world in each language, so I follow the tutorials on the command and how to compile and run the programs.

The second subtask was mostly unchartered territory, it was all new things which I haven't done in class, unlike the hello world programs. I looked up how exactly I should approach this problem and thought of the logic for it. The program had to read the file in input.txt, store it in a buffer and copy it to the output.txt file. It also checks whether the file can be opened or not. I did use chatgpt a bit for this

The third subtask was a very interesting one. Creating a pattern of asteriks with an input number. I did use chatgpt for this but made sure to not just copy paste and actually learn how the program works. so the program asks us for an input to decide the size of the diamond, it then calculates the top half of the diamond by increasing the number of asteriks with each line and spacing it appropriately. it does the same with the lower half but decreasing the number from the input we gave.
In the case of even numbers, the middle two lines have the same number of asteriks

The fourth subtask combined the third and second subtask by having a number as input in a file and the program reads that file and generates an output of diamond asteriks based on the number in the file, if the file doesn't have a number, it generates an error message.
