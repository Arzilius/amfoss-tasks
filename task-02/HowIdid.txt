How I did task 2

Subtask 1)
Before the task, I had successfully cloned the repository into my system without any problems(thankfully). I had also created a handbook directory. I did the ls command to list files in the Arrakis directory. As the riddle said, a place with a roof, the only one of which seemed to be Eolian caves, I went there. To use the cd command I had to put cd 'Eolian Caves' instead of just cd Eolian Caves, so that took a couple tries. I then used the find command on each entrance til I found the one with the parchment. After that, I used the cat command to run the file and saw the message, I also recieved the code. I copy pasted that into a text editor and saved it into my handbook folder

Subtask 2) 
This was the hardest task for me so far, mainly due to stupid reasons. I used git branch -a to see the list of availible branches and went to the one that said light realm. I used the tree command to checkout all the directories at once and found the python script for KharnokTheBloodForged. The difficult part for me was getting the code, I thought for a few days the files should contain either good or holy and proceeded. It took me a while and a friend telling me that there's only two files tw figure out that the file should contain BOTH 'good' and holy', once I got that sorted, I figured out the code and proceeded with the bossfight. After beating the boss, I found the celestial amulet and the light realm chest from where I got the code

Subtask 3)
This was an easy one for me. I had gotten the celestial amulet code from subtask 2. I then used git checkout to change the branches between dark realm I and II, unlocked the chests and got their codes too

Subtask 4)
This was another small one. It was easy but took a few tries. I first used the celestial veil code in the final code then realized that it was only needed for unlocking the chests. I used the codes for the parchment in subtask1, the light realm code I got, and the two dark realm codes. I went to the link and decoded the thing

Subtask 5)
I had cloned the repository into my system after getting the decoded link for it.
I used git log and it showed me a bunch of details including Aman chettan's email. I then used git show using each stage's code, it showed me the lore about the task and also worked as an ls command, showing me what's inside it. When I did that for the second stage, I did ls and saw an 'Open Book' folder inside of which was scripture.txt. When I did it for the third stage, I found a message with a code, the code was similar to the one we had to decode, so I decoded that and it gave me a link to a github repo, which says to clone that repo and run the victory.py file.
Which I did and it showed me the final message. I took the screenshot and pasted that into the handbook folder
